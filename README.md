当看到开赤色花的三角梅时，内心开始默想起一句诗来，一枝不安于室来。你看，三角梅，那赤色的花，在墙壁上在春天开的是那么灿烂，那么兴盛，且蔓延到墙外路，真好个时髦的场合，出尽了风头
七岁时我就已入学，在那时的农村还算是年龄偏小的了。乡村的小学总是有做不完的作业，而我偏又是个听话的孩子。于是，每天晚上，在昏暗的煤油灯下，母亲一边纳着鞋底，一边陪我做作业。　　到了夏天，潮湿的老屋更是成了蚊蝇的快乐场所，但家里没钱买电扇，又无什么“雷达”、蚊香。所以，每次只能穿着长裤、长袖，擦着汗填方格纸，或者把双腿伸进了装满凉水的水桶里。现在想来，如果没有母亲那种陪伴下地按时作业，我的成绩不会如此顺利地考上大学；如果没有蚊叮汗流下的执著，我说不定没经过那个黑色七月就已被淘汰；如果没有……　　虽然我现在住在小城那光洁如新的小楼里，拥有楼上楼下、电灯电话，甚至于用上了空调、足不出户还能上网，这已远远实现了儿时的梦想。　　在真正变成了城里人后，但有一种感觉却开始莫明其妙地慢慢地爬上我的心头，那就是我总觉得在离开老屋的时候，似乎有什么东西落在老屋没有带来。　　我想，这也许和我的奶奶有关吧，因为那个时候很多晴朗得可以数得出星星的夏夜，奶奶和我都有很多很多闲暇的时间，于是奶奶就会时常在水缸边上跟我讲书童与秀才的故事。　　后来慢慢地我就越来越忙了，上学、考试、升级、毕业，而奶奶也就显得越来越闲了。因为以前总让她讲故事听的那个缠人的小孙子已经渐渐地长大了，懂得的事情也就越来越多，自然对她的那些老掉牙的故事不感兴趣了。　　于是，在那些明朗的夏夜里，奶奶也就只好经常一个人静静地坐在水缸边上。直到奶奶去世后，我才发现那些故事居然占据了我整个童年。

When he saw the red flower of bougainvillea, the heart began to meditate on a poem, a restless in the room.
You see, bougainvillea, the red flower, on the wall in spring is so brilliant, so flourishing, and spread to wall WaiLu, it's nice to be a fashionable occasions, cut a swath
Has the entrance, when I was seven years old at the time of the rural is small age.
Rural primary school is always do not over of homework, but I again is an obedient child.
So, every night, under the dim kerosene lamps, mother's side of the sole, accompany me to do my homework.
In summer, damp house became the flies happy place more, but have no money to buy electric fans, home nor what "radar", mosquito-repellent incense.
So, every time can only wear pants and long sleeve, wipe the sweat fill ruling paper, or put the legs into a bucket full of water.
Now that I think about it, if no mother that accompany the above assignments on time, my grades would not be so successfully admitted to the university;
If there is no mosquito ding sweat shed clinging, maybe I didn't after the black July has been eliminated;
If there is no...
Even though I now live in a town that is bright and clean as new building, have upstairs and downstairs, the light telephone, even using air conditioning, never leave home can also get to the Internet, it has far achieved a childhood dream.
After the real into the city, but have a feeling to somehow slowly climbed the depth of my heart, that's what I always feel to leave their houses, does not seem to bring something fell on the house.
I think that maybe related to my grandmother, because at that time many sunny enough to count stars come to the summer night, my grandma and I have a lot of leisure time, so my grandma will often tell me extremely on the edge of the tank and the rank of story.
Later I will slowly more and more busy, school, examination, upgrade, graduation, and grandma also becomes more and more idle.
Because before the story listens to let her that pesky little grandson has gradually grown up, knows things are more and more, natural to her is not interested in those old story.
So, in the clear summer night, grandma also had to often a person quietly sitting on the edge of the tank.
Until my grandmother died, I just found out that the story has occupied my whole childhood.
